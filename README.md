# FACIS: Federation Architecture for Composed Infrastructure Services

## Introduction  
The FACIS landing page act as an entry-point for all open-source components, specification, and implementation developed under FACIS project. The goal is to guide the developers and contributors with the foundational blueprints to build a secure, interoperable and scalable multi-provider cloud-edge continuum. 

FACIS combines innovative technologies such as **Federation Architecture Patterns (FAPs)**, **machine-readable Service Level Agreements (SLAs)**, and **low-code orchestration engines**. These along with strong governance frameworks, improves scalability, security, and compliance with regulations, while enabling organizations to retain control of their data. 

 FACIS is an **open-source and collaborative project** that promotes transparency, inclusiveness, and innovation across the European digital ecosystem. 

Code-related deliverables are published via GitHub, while non-code results- such as frameworks, rulebooks and other supporting materials are and will be made available on the FACIS website : [https://www.facis.eu/results/](https://www.facis.eu/results/)
