# IoT & AI over Trusted Zones
The Federation Architecture Pattern (FAP) on IoT and AI shows how data, in federated ecosystems, can be collected from many devices (sensors), shared securely, brought together in one place, and then can be analyzed with Artificial Intelligence so it can be clearly shown on a dashboard.

The goal of the IoT-AI FAP is to make it easy to connect any IoT devices with different data systems and AI tools in a standard and flexible way. It can also run safely inside a company’s own network — even without internet. The FAP creates a trusted setup that lets organizations securely collect, share, combine, and analyze IoT data across different locations and partners.

#### Process overview
1. Multi-Channeling :
Gathers edge data and manages multiple data channels.

2. Standardizing :
Standardizes data transfer between sender and receiver using the dataspace protocol.

3. Aggregating :
Enables cloud-based data aggregation.

4. Using AI
Supports AI-driven data analysis.

5. Visualizing :
Visualizes results as dashboard widgets for each data channel.
