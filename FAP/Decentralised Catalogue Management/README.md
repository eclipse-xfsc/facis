# Decentralised Catalogue Management
This Federation Architecture Pattern (FAP) on Decentralized Catalogue Management (DCM) makes it easier to find and compare services from different providers for a company or organization without having to store everything in one central place. Instead of separate, isolated catalogues, they are linked together.

This FAP addresses one of the key challenges in federated ecosystems: fragmented and siloed service catalogues. Its purpose is to enable discovery, comparison, and integration of digital services like cloud and resources like product passport across multiple catalogues without centralizing them. 

By introducing a multi-catalogue abstraction layer, it allows seamless cross-catalogue searches, service registration, and metadata harmonization while ensuring interoperability, transparency and supporting compliance requirements. 

#### Key Benefits

- Service Discoverability: 
  Enhances service discoverability across multiple cloud offerings, data spaces, and domains.

- Decouplement:
  Reduces vendor lock-in and decouples catalogue management.

- Sovereignty:
  Supports sovereignty and trust through verifiable service and resource listings.

- Cross-border Scalability:
  Enables scalability for cross-border and cross-sector federations.
