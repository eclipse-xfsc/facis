# Proof-of-Concepts (Poc)
Real-world scenarios implementation and validation demonstrating the FAPs and DCS.

## Synergies with PoC  
FAPs are closely linked to **Proof of Concepts (PoCs)**, ensuring smooth transition from design to real-world validation:  
- Use case identification in FAPs ↔ business problem definition in PoC  
- Scenario specifications in FAPs ↔ technical requirements in PoC  
- Low-code orchestration in FAPs informs tool selection in PoC  
- QA in FAPs ↔ risk assessment & validation in PoC  

This alignment accelerates adoption by ensuring architectural patterns are validated through **industry-grade pilots**.
