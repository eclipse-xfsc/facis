# SLA Governance Framework
FACIS introduces a framework for governing **Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** across federated ecosystems.  
Instead of static, text-heavy documents, FACIS promotes **machine-readable SLAs** that can be enforced and monitored automatically.  
This ensures quality of service, reliability, and compliance across multiple providers and borders.  
It also reduces operational complexity by enabling automated SLA negotiation, violation detection, and adaptation in real time.  

## Potential Extensions  
Future enhancements and extensions include:  
- SLA Governance (latency, uptime tracking, SLA violation detection)  
- Analytics & AI integration for anomaly detection and dashboards  
- Multi-region and edge deployments for compliance and data residency  
- Open-source release of Micro-FAPs with Docker images and adapters
