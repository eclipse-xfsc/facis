## Zero Trust Demonstrators
The FACIS  Zero Trust Demonstrator will showcase the interaction between two trust zones as individual Federations, which a sharing digital services between entitled participants and principals, based on Policy Rules.

The two trust zones a interconnected via a Trust Management Infrastructure (TRAIN ). The purpose of TRAIN is to provide components for establishing and verifying the root of trust for participants in the federated ecosystem and credentials issued by these entities. This is achieved through the introduction of trust lists combined with anchoring of pointers in the DNS.

The Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM ) is based on Self Sovereign Identity (SSI) Principles to build community federations. 
In general it is a group of participants who agree on a set of governance rules for data exchange, without the need of being member of any legal construct. It's a group of loosely coupled actors which interact to each other. Actually they just need a set of governance rules and similar technology to trust each other which is a good fit for zero trust combined with SSI concepts and the triangle of trust.
